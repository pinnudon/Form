# Form
Its a simple form like we have seen google forms.It take some input from the user basically their name,address etc.This form is designed only for better understanding of mine in nodejs, mongoDb and templates of nodes(hbs).Also note that node modules has also not uploaded here eg express,and modules like bodyparser,mongoose etc. the main file is located in form.js.
This was my one of the initial small projects.
